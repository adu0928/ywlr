If I could， I surely would。
May there be enough clouds in your life to make a beautiful sunset。
The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can’t have them。
No pains， no gains。
Life is like a box of chocolates， you never know what you are going to get。
 You must always have faith in who you are！
The longest day has an end。
Don‘t cry because it is over， smile because it happened。
 When you feel like hope is gone， look inside you and search your soul。 you will find a hero lies in you。 dreams are hard to follow， but don‘t let anyone steal your dream。
To be， or not to be - that is the question
